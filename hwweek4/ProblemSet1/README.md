Hw week 4

For this problem I used a extra number as indiscator of testing the arraycontrainer function, in order to print out either true of false

However this is one warning showing as below and I'm not sure how to solve it

"ProblemSet4.1.c:21:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void 
function [-Wreturn-type]} "
